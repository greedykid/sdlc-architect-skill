# SDLC Architect

An agent skill for developing applications through an iterative SDLC workflow with repo-native documentation, Mermaid UML diagrams, and anti-slop quality gates.

## Repository layout

```text

├── SKILL.md

```

The root plugin manifests make the skill discoverable as a Codex plugin. The skill itself stays portable and can also be copied from `skills/sdlc-architect/` into an Agent Skills-compatible skills directory.

## What it covers

- Agile SDLC from discovery through delivery and maintenance.
- Traceability between requirements, design decisions, implementation, and tests.
- Use case, activity, sequence, class/domain, component, and deployment diagrams in Mermaid.
- Anti-slop routing for UI, copy, accessibility, responsive layout, visual assets, and code comments.

## Validation

Run the repository guardrail check:

```bash
node scripts/check-repo.mjs
```

The skill itself can also be validated with the Codex skill validator:

```bash
python3 /path/to/skill-creator/scripts/quick_validate.py skills/sdlc-architect
```
